## Frequent used commands
### [UPDATED!] To avoid problems in running
- first run `python manage.py runserver` under `website` folder (DO NOT open link in the compiler)
- open another terminal
- then run `npm start` under `website/frontend` folder
- test on the site which previous command leads to
- p.s. if you are testing on frontend, you can run `npm start` without starting the server.
### For server
- python manage.py runserver
### For React
- npm run build
